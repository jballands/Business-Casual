<h1>The Formal Business Casual Framework</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>

It looks as though you've stumbled into my repository. Oh crap.

<b>Business Casual</b> is a super-simple minimalistic front-end "framework"
that I designed for <a href="http://jonathanballands.me" target="_blank">my website</a>.
Basically, a bunch of people saw it and asked if it was Bootstrap, of which
I felt ridiculously proud n' stuff. People asked if I had this so-called "framework"
on GitHub because they want to pull it. And that's where it all got a bit awkward.

True <b>Business Casual</b> is very crappy. Very, very
<a href="http://jonathanballands.me/businesscasual/about.html" target="_blank">crappy</a>.
So rather than provide people with my poopy-ass code, I figured I'd fix it up a bit,
add some more features, write it in <a href="http://lesscss.org" target="_blank">LESS</a>,
and try to make it a bit more usable. I'm calling this version
<b>Formal Business Casual</b>, and it's pretty much an expriment to see if I can
actually write one of these shits.

<h2>Isn't the name "Formal Business Casual" oximoronic?</h2>

Well, well, well... looks who's got the clever coconut.

<h2>Is this real life?</h2>

No. Not really. I wouldn't take any notice of anything I do.
