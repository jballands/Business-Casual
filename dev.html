                    <p>Business Casual is a framework I originally built for

                    with you. See what makes Business Casual tick and extend it with your own features, or just take bits and
                    pieces to work with your own code. I promise I won't mind.</p>

            <p>In general, the structure of Business Casual can be broken down into three parts:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>The development part</li>
                    <li>The building part</li>
                    <li>The production part</li>
                </ol>
                
            <p>You can think of the building part as the ice cream in an ice cream sandwich, binding
            the two chocolate cake pieces together. Both the development part and the production part define
            the same rules and instructions; the way those pieces appear, however, are very different.</p>
            
            <p>The following graphic depicts the Business Casual development workflow, abstracting out the
            development, building, and production parts:</p>

            </div>
            
            <h2>The Development Part</h2>
            
            <p>This part of the Business Casual workflow is where you'll actually write code. The development
            part is written in two programming languages: LESS and Javascript.</p>

                            LESS is a CSS pre-processor that allows you to use logic, control paths, and variables in your stylesheets.
                            Once you have written LESS code, you need to compile that code into CSS in order for it to work in the
                            browser. <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more.

            <p>LESS code exists in the <code>/less</code> directory and is broken down into 11 files. Out of these files, 4 of them
            are important in order to understand the structure of Business Casual:</p>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <p>If you wish to add another LESS file to extend Business Casual, by all means do so; just remember to add an import
            statement in <code>business-casual.less</code>.</p>
            
            <table class="rounded-table">

                            The order of the import statements in <code>business-casual.less</code> matter! When you add your own
                            import statement, you should always add it to the end of <code>business-casual.less</code> for safety.

            <p>Javascript code exists in the <code>/js</code> directory under the file <code>business-casual.js</code> and is
            minimized directly by Grunt. Since this
            file has a very particular stucture to it, we will discuss this file in detail in the
            <a href="#javascript">Javascript</a> section.</p>
            
            <h2>The Building Part</h2>
            
            <p>Once you have finished writting Javascript and LESS code, it's time to "build" Business Casual by running
            it through a task runner known as <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a>.
            "Building" refers to the process of verifying, consolidating, and shrinking
            your code to something smaller and more manageable.</p>
            
            <p>Grunt is a piece of software that automates the building process for you. Grunt is written in Javascript (traditionally
            a language for web browsers) and therefore must run on a platform called 
            <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node</a>. The process for installation is described
            on the <a href="index.html#customize" target="_blank">main Business Casual website</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Grunt uses two plugins to build your code: <code>lessc</code> and Uglify. <code>lessc</code> is a LESS compiler
            that takes all your LESS files and consolidates them into a single CSS file. Uglify is a Javascript compiler
            that minimizes your Javascript to reduce its file size and loading times. These plugins are installed
            using the <code>npm install</code> command on your command line.</p>
            
            <table class="rounded-table">
                <tbody>
                    <tr class="left">
                        <th class="info">
                            <span class="bold">Pro tip</span><br/>
                            Uglify gets its name because minimized Javascript is completely incomprehensible, i.e. ugly.
                        </th>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <h2>The Production Part</h2>
            
            <p>This is the part of the Business Casual workflow that you will use to style your website. There are only two
            files that you have to include in your HTML code to style it with Business Casual: <code>business-casual.css</code>
            and <code>business-casual.min.js</code>.</p>
            
            <p>Both <code>business-casual.css</code> and <code>business-casual.min.js</code> are much smaller than their
            developmental counterparts. Grunt will report exactly how much your code was reduced when you run it. For example,
            LESS starting at 22.45kB will shrink to 18.21kB, and Javascript starting at 21.44kB will shrink to 7.56kB. This is
            beneficial because it reduces the amount of dependencies in your website and it allows your website to load
            much faster.</p>

            <p>If you ever got to look at
            <a href="https://github.com/jballands/Business-Casual/blob/602bfc5a222dca3ace436d0b4e496bde2a94034e/js/business-casual.js"
               target="_blank">older versions</a> of <code>business-casual.js</code>, you knew that the code was complicated and hard
            to extend.
            Starting with BC v1.2, <code>business-casual.js</code> has been completely refactored to alleviate many of problems encountered
            when working with BC JS. Some of the design goals for the refactoring of BC JS are described below:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Create a one-to-one relationship between DOM elements and JS objects</li>
                <li>Abstract out the complicated parts of Javascript programming to make BC easier to extend</li>
                <li>Force JS objects to interact with browser properties through a well-defined JS framework</li>
                <li>Prevent spaghetti code from occuring</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The following sections briefly discuss the different parts of BC JS and how you can interact with them to add your own dynamic features
            to Business Casual.</p>
            
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
            <div class="flexor" id="landing-icons">
                <div class="column-7">
                    <img src="img/dev/bcjs.png" style="width:425px;"/>
                </div>
                <div class="column-5" style="text-align:left">
                    <p>In general, BC JS is made up of four important components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <code>BusinessCasual</code> object</li>
                        <li>The <code>Service</code> objects</li>
                        <li>The <code>Broadcaster</code> object</li>
                        <li>BC DOM objects</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each of these four components work together in order to create dynamic features in Business Casual. Before we go in depth on each
                    component, let's briefly discuss each of their roles in Business Casual:</p>
                </div>
                    
            </div>
            
            <h4>The BusinessCasual Object</h4>
            
            <p>The <code>BusinessCasual</code> object is a singleton object that acts as the controller for all of BC JS. This object acts as the face of BC JS,
            kicking off all the processes necessary for BC JS to work.
            
            <h4>BC DOM Objects</h4>
            
            <p>BC DOM Objects are the bread and butter of BC JS. BC DOM Objects are objects that embody the behavior of a particular Business Casual feature as a
            prototype. In other words, for each Business Casual dynamic feature, there exists a BC DOM Object that defines the behaviors of that particular feature.</p>
            
            <h4>The Service Objects</h4>
            
            <p>The <code>Service</code> objects are special objects designed to wrap around browser environment variables so that many BC DOM Objects can touch
            the same variable at once. BC DOM Objects can subscribe to a particular service to take advantage of a particular browser environment variable without
            interfering with other BC DOM Objects.</p>
            
            <h4>The Broadcaster Object</h4>
            
            <p>The <code>Broadcaster</code> object is a singleton object that allows variables to be shared across BC DOM Objects. <code>Broadcaster</code>
            provides a safe way for BC DOM Objects to create global variables and have them shared amongst themselves.</p>
            
            <h2>Implementing Your Own Features</h2>
                
            <p>To implement your own custom feature within Business Casual, you will have to either extend the functionality of an existing
            BC DOM Object, or create your own DOM object for use in HTML, and then write the BC JS code to give it dynamic features. We will assume,
            for this walkthorugh, that you want to do the latter.</p>
            
            <p>In general, there are five steps to
            implementing your custom feature:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Design your DOM object</li>
                <li>Add your DOM object as an "available"</li>
